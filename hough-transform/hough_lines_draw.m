function hough_lines_draw (img, outfile, peaks, rho, theta)

    % Draw the lines found in an image using Hough transform.
    % Infinite lines, rather than line segments, are fine.
    % Overlay the lines in green on top of the image.
    % Output the line image to a file.

    % Params:
    % img:     Image on top of which to draw lines
    % outfile: Output image filename to save plot as
    % peaks:   Qx2 matrix containing row/col indices of Q peaks found in accum
    % rho:     Vector of rho values, in pixels
    % theta:   Vector of theta values, in degrees
